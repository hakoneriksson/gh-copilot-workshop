# IP
*Handled*

<!-- Note:
Can you be sure you do not infringe on someone else's IP?

The insurance from Microsoft that any legal issues will be covered is not in effect if you modify the code generated by Copilot
Which we probably always will do...

-->

---
# GDPR
*Handled*
<!-- Note:

Tracking of user data may be disabled - only in personal subscriptions

Can you be sure you do not expose sensitive data?


Can you be sure that the code generated is not biased in some way ?
We know that the GPT models are biased, how may that effect the code generated?

# Productivity pressure
*faster & better*
<!-- - Cut in staff -->

<!-- Note:
- X % faster
- Y % better

Sale in GitHub and leadership

Github states:
- Improving developer satisfaction. Between 60–75% of users reported they feel more fulfilled with their job, feel less frustrated when coding, and are able to focus on more satisfying work when using GitHub Copilot
- Developers who used GitHub Copilot completed the task significantly faster–55% faster than the developers who didn’t use GitHub Copilot

Some leaders may take this raw and 
- Add pressure on productivity
- Cut in staffing

# Cognitive ergonomics
*avoid all raising stress levels*

<!-- Note:
* What are your concerns?
* What are your experiences?

- Feeling of being overwhelmed
- Anxiety caused by rapid growth and uncertainty
- Fear of being replaced by AI
- Fear of being judged by AI
- Technology addiction

All raising stress levels and potentially leading to burnout

* Any mitigations?
- code reviews, testing, pair programming, training, understanding the code
-->

---
# Quality
*some studies have shown higher code churn after the introduction of AI tools*

---
# Safety & Security
*secrets and understanding*

---

# Craftmanship

*in the end: you/we are responsible for the code*

<!-- Note:
Some positive aspects on the end

Stackoverflow on steroids

The assistants may show you how to do things you did not know how to do
Or new ways of doing things

Starting something new may be easier avoiding the initial hurdles

To get most out of the tool you need to be precise in your intentions - learning prompt engineering and technical english may help you achieve that

Can a side effect be that we get better at stating and communicating our intentions? Which will improve our work on other areas as well.


This concludes the reflection part and our presentation

Some links to resources and studies are coming up on the next slides
